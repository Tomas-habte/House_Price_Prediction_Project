# House Price Prediction Project
## Overview
As our final project, we have decided to predict house prices using historical data and machine learning. We chose the topic of predicting house prices because the housing market has been widely talked about especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also chose this topic because it affects all of us in one way or another. Our analysis will answer two questions: how accurately can a model predict the sale price of a house and what are the most important features that impact the price of a house? There are two datasets being used for this analysis: data on house prices sold in Seattle, Washington, USA between August and December 2022 from Kaggle and data on the coordinates of the houses sold using Google API. The data on house prices sold contains both training and testing data with columns 'beds','baths','size','size_units','lot_size','lot_size_units','zip_code', and	'price'. The target column is 'price' and the other columns are the features. We will visualize the data of the houses sold with their prices in Tableau.
