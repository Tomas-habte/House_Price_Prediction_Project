# House Price Prediction Project
## Overview
As our final project, we have decided to predict house prices using historical data and machine learning. We chose this topic because the housing market is widely talked about, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also chose this topic because the housing market affects all of us in one way or another. Our analysis will help to answer two questions: how accurately can a model predict the sale price of a house and what are the most important features that can impact the price of a house? 

**Dataset**
- There are two datasets being used for this analysis: data on houses with their prices sold in Seattle, Washington, USA between August and December 2022 from Kaggle, and data on all houses in the United States with their zip codes and coordinates.
-  Fortunately, the data we found on Kaggle is well-structured (**link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/house-price-prediction-seattle). 
-  The main challenge we faced while choosing the dataset is that the topics we found interesting had complex data that required a lot of cleaning or was difficult to find. Therefore, we searched for data that was reasonably easy to work with. 
-  The data on houses with their prices sold contains both training and testing data with columns 'beds', 'baths', 'size', 'size_units', 'lot_size', 'lot_size_units', 'zip_code', and 'price'. The target column is 'price' and the other columns are the features. 
**Technologies**
-  For our second dataset, we were able to extract the coordinates for the houses in Seattle using VLOOKUP in Excel. We are planning to visualize the data of our model in Tableau. Currently, we are working on a simple machine learning model to determine how it will work.
