# House Price Prediction Project
## Overview
As our final project, we have decided to predict house prices using historical data and machine learning. We chose this topic because the housing market has been widely talked about especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also chose this topic because housing prices affects all of us in one way or another. Our analysis will answer two questions: how accurately can a model predict the sale price of a house and what are the most important features that can impact the price of a house? There are two datasets being used for this analysis: data on house prices sold in Seattle, Washington, USA between August and December 2022 from Kaggle, and data on the coordinates of the houses sold using Google API. Fortunately, the data we found on Kaggle is well-structured and did not pose any challenges for us. The data on house prices sold contains both training and testing data with columns 'beds','baths','size','size_units','lot_size','lot_size_units','zip_code', and	'price'. The target column is 'price' and the other columns are the features. We are planning to visualize the data of the houses sold with their prices in Tableau. Currently, we are working on a simple machine learning model without any data cleaning to determine how it will work.
